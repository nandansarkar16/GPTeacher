STUDENT QUERY: 
I am stuck on the following problem. What is the solution? 

List the following elements in order of increasing electronegativity: O, Ge, C

EXPERT SOLUTION:

**Ge < C < O**

Reason: Electronegativity increases left→right across a period and decreases down a group. Germanium is below carbon in Group 14 (so it’s less electronegative), and oxygen is to the right of carbon in Period 2 (so it’s more electronegative). On the Pauling scale: Ge ≈ 2.0, C ≈ 2.55, O ≈ 3.44.

STUDENT QUERY: 
I am stuck on the following problem. What is the solution? 

Indicate the molecular geometry of the following compounds (which disobey the octet rule): a) SF4 b) XeF4 c) PF5 d) SeF6

EXPERT SOLUTION:

Use VSEPR: **steric number = (# bonding regions) + (# lone pairs on the central atom)**.
Electron-domain geometry is set by the steric number; the **molecular** geometry depends on where any lone pairs sit.

**a) SF₄**

* S valence e⁻ = 6. Four S–F single bonds use 4 pairs; remaining 2 e⁻ = **1 lone pair**.
* Steric number = 4 (bonds) + 1 (LP) = **5** → **trigonal-bipyramidal electron geometry**.
* In TBP, a lone pair prefers an **equatorial** site to minimize 90° repulsions.
* Removing the LP from the visible shape gives **seesaw** molecular geometry.
* Angles ≈ 90°, 120°, 180° (slightly distorted by the lone pair).

**b) XeF₄**

* Xe valence e⁻ = 8. Four Xe–F bonds use 4 pairs; remaining 4 e⁻ = **2 lone pairs**.
* Steric number = 4 + 2 = **6** → **octahedral electron geometry**.
* Two LPs in an octahedron go **opposite (trans)** to minimize repulsion.
* Atoms occupy the equatorial plane → **square planar** molecular geometry.
* Angles ≈ 90°, 180°.

**c) PF₅**

* P valence e⁻ = 5. Five P–F bonds; **0 lone pairs**.
* Steric number = 5 + 0 = **5** → **trigonal-bipyramidal** molecular (and electron) geometry.
* Angles ≈ 90° (axial–equatorial), 120° (equatorial–equatorial), 180° (axial–axial).

**d) SeF₆**

* Se valence e⁻ = 6. Six Se–F bonds; **0 lone pairs**.
* Steric number = 6 + 0 = **6** → **octahedral** molecular (and electron) geometry.
* Angles ≈ 90°, 180°.

**Final shapes:**
a) **seesaw** b) **square planar** c) **trigonal bipyramidal** d) **octahedral**

STUDENT QUERY: 
I am stuck on the following problem. What is the solution? 

For each of the following fatty acids, indicate whether it is saturated or unsaturated. If it is unsaturated, indicate how many carbon-carbon double bonds it contains: a) C13H23COOH b) C13H27COOH

EXPERT SOLUTION:

A straight-chain saturated fatty acid with **n** total carbons has the formula **CₙH₂ₙO₂**.
Each C=C double bond lowers the hydrogen count by 2 (so an unsaturated acid with **k** double bonds is **CₙH₂ₙ₋₂kO₂**).

First convert the given “C₁₃H₂₃COOH / C₁₃H₂₇COOH” to full molecular formulas by adding the COOH group explicitly (adds **C₁H₁O₂**):

* **a) C₁₃H₂₃COOH → C₁₄H₂₄O₂.**
  For n=14, a saturated acid would be C₁₄H₂₈O₂. We have H₂₄, which is 4 fewer hydrogens → **2 double bonds**.
  **Answer: unsaturated, 2 C=C.**

* **b) C₁₃H₂₇COOH → C₁₄H₂₈O₂.**
  This matches the saturated formula exactly → **0 double bonds**.
  **Answer: saturated.**

*(Assuming an acyclic chain—no rings.)*

I am stuck on the following problem. What is the solution? 

To change the temperature of a particular calorimeter and the water it contains by one degree Celsius requires 6485 Joules. The complete combustion of 1.40 g of ethylene gas, C2H4, in the calorimeter causes a temperature rise of 10.7 degrees. Find the heat of combustion per mole of ethylene.

EXPERT SOLUTION:

Calorimeter heat capacity (C = 6485\ \mathrm{J,^\circ C^{-1}}).
Temperature rise (\Delta T = 10.7\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}).

1. Heat absorbed by the calorimeter–water (equal in magnitude to heat released by the reaction):
   [
   q_{\text{cal}} = C,\Delta T = 6485 \times 10.7 = 6.93895\times 10^{4}\ \mathrm{J} = 69.3895\ \mathrm{kJ}.
   ]

2. Moles of ethylene burned:
   [
   M(\mathrm{C_2H_4}) = 2(12.01) + 4(1.008) = 28.052\ \mathrm{g,mol^{-1}},
   ]
   [
   n = \frac{1.40\ \mathrm{g}}{28.052\ \mathrm{g,mol^{-1}}} = 4.991\times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{mol}.
   ]

3. Heat of combustion (per mole) = (\displaystyle \frac{|q_{\text{rxn}}|}{n}). The reaction is exothermic, so the sign is negative:
   [
   \Delta H_\text{comb} = -,\frac{69.3895\ \mathrm{kJ}}{4.991\times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{mol}}
   = -1.39\times 10^{3}\ \mathrm{kJ,mol^{-1}}.
   ]

**Answer:** (\boxed{\Delta H_\text{comb}(\mathrm{C_2H_4}) \approx -1.39\times 10^{3}\ \mathrm{kJ,mol^{-1}}}) (3 s.f.).

I am stuck on the following problem. What is the solution? 

7. Calculate \Delta H for the reaction: N2H4
(l) + O2
(g) -> N2
(g) + 2 H2O(l)
given the following data:
2 NH3
(g) + 3 N2O(g) -> 4 N2
(g) + 3 H2O(l) \Delta H = -1010 kJ
N2O(g) + 3 H2
(g) -> N2H4
(l) + H2O(l) \Delta H = -317 kJ
2 NH3
(g) + ½ O2
(g) -> N2H4
(l) + H2O(l) \Delta H = -143 kJ
H2
(g) + ½ O2
(g) -> H2O(l) \Delta H = -286 kJ

EXPERT SOLUTION:

We want (\Delta H) for:
[
\text{(T)}\quad \mathrm{N_2H_4(l)} + \mathrm{O_2(g)} ;\longrightarrow; \mathrm{N_2(g)} + 2,\mathrm{H_2O(l)} .
]

Use Hess’s law. Combine the given reactions (scaling/reversing as needed) so that all intermediates (NH(_3), N(_2)O, H(_2)) cancel, leaving (T).

A convenient combination is:

* ((1)\times \tfrac14):\quad ( \tfrac12,\mathrm{NH_3} + \tfrac34,\mathrm{N_2O} \to \mathrm{N_2} + \tfrac34,\mathrm{H_2O} ) (\Delta H = \tfrac14(-1010) = -252.5\ \mathrm{kJ})
* ((2)) **reversed** (\times \tfrac34):\quad ( \tfrac34,\mathrm{N_2H_4} + \tfrac34,\mathrm{H_2O} \to \tfrac34,\mathrm{N_2O} + \tfrac94,\mathrm{H_2} ) (\Delta H = +\tfrac34(317) = +237.75\ \mathrm{kJ})
* ((3)) **reversed** (\times \tfrac14):\quad ( \tfrac14,\mathrm{N_2H_4} + \tfrac14,\mathrm{H_2O} \to \tfrac12,\mathrm{NH_3} + \tfrac18,\mathrm{O_2} ) (\Delta H = +\tfrac14(143) = +35.75\ \mathrm{kJ})
* ((4)\times \tfrac94):\quad ( \tfrac94,\mathrm{H_2} + \tfrac98,\mathrm{O_2} \to \tfrac94,\mathrm{H_2O} ) (\Delta H = \tfrac94(-286) = -643.5\ \mathrm{kJ})

Add these four adjusted equations. NH(_3), N(_2)O, and H(_2) cancel, and the net result is exactly
[
\mathrm{N_2H_4} + \mathrm{O_2} \to \mathrm{N_2} + 2,\mathrm{H_2O}.
]

Sum the enthalpies:
[
\Delta H = (-252.5) + ( +237.75) + ( +35.75) + (-643.5) = -622.5\ \mathrm{kJ}.
]

[
\boxed{\Delta H \approx -6.23\times 10^2\ \mathrm{kJ}\ \text{for } \mathrm{N_2H_4(l)} + \mathrm{O_2(g)} \to \mathrm{N_2(g)} + 2,\mathrm{H_2O(l)}}

I am stuck on the following problem. What is the solution? 

The breakdown of nitrous oxide gas (N2O) to nitrogen gas and oxygen gas is believed to
occur in two steps. In the first step, nitrous oxide breaks down to form nitrogen gas and a
free oxygen atom.
a) Write a balanced equation for the overall reaction (do not use fractional coefficients).
b) Write balanced equations for each of the two steps.
c) Which substance could be considered a ""reaction intermediate?""

EXPERT SOLUTION:

The proposed mechanism says the first step makes an oxygen atom. Let’s construct the overall reaction and a two-step sequence consistent with that.

**a) Overall balanced equation (no fractional coefficients):**
[
\boxed{2,\mathrm{N_2O(g)} ;\longrightarrow; 2,\mathrm{N_2(g)} + \mathrm{O_2(g)}}
]
(This is the integer-coefficient version of (\mathrm{N_2O \to N_2 + \tfrac12 O_2}).)

**b) Balanced equations for the two steps:**

1. Decomposition to make an oxygen atom (as stated):
   [
   \mathrm{N_2O(g)} ;\longrightarrow; \mathrm{N_2(g)} + \mathrm{O(g)}
   ]
2. Consumption of that oxygen atom to form (\mathrm{O_2}):
   [
   \mathrm{O(g)} + \mathrm{N_2O(g)} ;\longrightarrow; \mathrm{N_2(g)} + \mathrm{O_2(g)}
   ]
   Adding (1) and (2) gives (2,\mathrm{N_2O} \to 2,\mathrm{N_2} + \mathrm{O_2}), as required.

**c) Reaction intermediate:**
[
\boxed{\mathrm{O(g)}\ \text{(atomic oxygen)}}
]
It is produced in step (1) and consumed in step (2), and it does not appear in the overall reaction.

What are the three types of intermolecular attractive forces and list them in order of
increasing strength?

EXPERT SOLUTION:

The three main intermolecular attractive forces (for neutral molecules) are:

1. **London dispersion forces** (instantaneous/induced dipoles) – weakest
2. **Dipole–dipole forces** (permanent dipole interactions) – intermediate
3. **Hydrogen bonding** (H bonded to N, O, or F interacting with a lone pair on N/O/F) – strongest

**Order of increasing strength:**
**London dispersion < Dipole–dipole < Hydrogen bonding**

*(Note: Actual strengths can vary with molecular size/shape; dispersion grows with polarizability.)*

Write a balanced net ionic equation for the reaction between solutions of HNO2

Which 2 species are acting as acids? as bases?

EXPERT SOLUTION:

**Reaction type:** weak acid (HNO₂) + strong base (KOH) → neutralization.

1. Write the species in solution and remove spectators (K⁺ is a spectator):
   [
   \mathrm{HNO_2(aq)} + \mathrm{OH^- (aq)} \rightarrow \mathrm{NO_2^- (aq)} + \mathrm{H_2O(l)}

2. **Acid–base roles (Brønsted–Lowry):**

* **Acids (proton donors):** (\mathrm{HNO_2}) (reactant) and (\mathrm{H_2O}) (product, conjugate acid of (\mathrm{OH^-})).
* **Bases (proton acceptors):** (\mathrm{OH^-}) (reactant) and (\mathrm{NO_2^-}) (product, conjugate base of (\mathrm{HNO_2})).

I am stuck on the following problem. What is the solution? 

Consider the following equilibrium: 
N2 (g) + 3 H2 (g) <-> 2 NH3 (g)

K is 4.51 x 10-5 at 450 degrees C. Is a mixture containing 100 atm NH3, 30 atm N2, and 500 atm H2 at equilibrium? If not, will the mixture shift toward
product or reactants to achieve equilibrium?

EXPERT SOLUTION:

For the gas‐phase equilibrium
[
\mathrm{N_2(g)}+3,\mathrm{H_2(g)}\rightleftharpoons 2,\mathrm{NH_3(g)},
]
the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures is
[
K_p=\frac{(P_{\mathrm{NH_3}})^2}{P_{\mathrm{N_2}}(P_{\mathrm{H_2}})^3}.
]

Compute the reaction quotient (Q_p) from the given partial pressures to test equilibrium:
[
Q_p=\frac{(100)^2}{(30),(500)^3}
=\frac{10{,}000}{30\times 125{,}000{,}000}
=\frac{10{,}000}{3.75\times 10^9}
\approx 2.67\times 10^{-6}.
]

Given (K_p=4.51\times 10^{-5}) at (450^\circ\mathrm{C}),
[
Q_p ;(2.67\times 10^{-6}) ;<; K_p ;(4.51\times 10^{-5}).
]

Since (Q_p<K_p), the mixture is **not** at equilibrium and will **shift toward products** (to the right), producing more (\mathrm{NH_3}) and consuming (\mathrm{N_2}) and (\mathrm{H_2}) until (Q_p) increases to (K_p).

Write (K_p=\dfrac{P_{\mathrm{NH_3}}^2}{P_{\mathrm{N_2}}P_{\mathrm{H_2}}^3}) and plug in the **current** pressures to get (Q_p). Compare (Q_p) to (K_p): if (Q_p<K_p), it shifts right (toward products); if (Q_p>K_p), it shifts left (toward reactants).
